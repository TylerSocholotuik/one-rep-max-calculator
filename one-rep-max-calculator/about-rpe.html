            <h2 class="fw-light mb-5">What is RPE?</h2>
            <p class="text-light text-start">RPE stands for Rate of Perceived Exertion. It is a rating on a 0 - 10 scale of how difficult a set <span class="fst-italic">felt</span>. The easiest way to choose this rating is to think about how many repitions you had left in reserve at the end of your set. After a maximal effort set, you would have 0 reps in reserve (RIR), which would be RPE 10. If it felt as though you had 1 repetition in reserve, the RPE rating would be 9. An RPE of 9.5 means you <span class="fst-italic">may</span> have been able to perform another rep, but it was close to a maximal effort. You can keep working your way down the scale in the same manner using your estimated repetitions in reserve. The calculator accepts a minimum RPE of 6 because research has shown that trainees can not accurately judge their repetitions in reserve below RPE 6, and there is also no data in that range to use in the calculation.</p>

            <h2 class="fw-light my-5">Why use RPE?</h2>
            <p class="text-light text-start">The purpose of RPE in resistance training is to facilitate <span class="fw-normal">auto-regulation</span>. In short, auto-regulation is the adjustment of training variables to account for variations in performance. Let's say you bench pressed 225 lbs for 3 sets of 8 reps last week, and today you plan to add 5 lbs. You only slept for 5 hours, you had a stressful day at work, and you had an argument with your significant other before you left home. Do you think you will be able to bench 230 lbs today? I don't think so.</p>

            <p class="text-light text-start">Here is where auto-regulation comes in. Instead of aiming to add 5 lbs to the bar every week, you set an RPE target for each of your sets. On a stressful day like today, you notice that your warm-up sets feel a lot heavier than normal. Instead of putting 230 lbs on the bar, you decide that 215 lbs will most likely feel like RPE 8 based on your last warm-up set. You are still getting an effective training stimulus, and you are generating much less fatigue than you would if you failed a set at 230 lbs. This style of training is not great for your ego, but it is much more sustainable in the long-run. Slow gains is better than no gains, so start auto-regulating your training and live to lift another day.</p>
